
/// class and objects


1. ClassName should be in caps 
2. we need to mention the return type of class method. otherwise it will through error
3. in main we need to create a class and reference variable to allocate space for outside class
4. class can have variable and method [public int add() - method, i - variable]


class Sum{
    int i=0;
    public int add(int c,int d){       
        
        int result = c+d;
        System.out.println(result);
        return 0;                   
    }
}

public class Main{
    public static void main(String a[]){

        int d= 3;
        int e= 6;
        Sum plus = new Sum();   //sum is a class name(should create a class with this name)
                               // plus is a reference variable we can use this to pass the method to external class
        plus.add(d,e);
   
    }
