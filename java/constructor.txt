

when the obj is created , if we didn't assign a value for obj.value default value will be 0
we can assign a value to the obj using Constructor

// Constructor

    Constructor name should be same as ClassName
    it doesn't retrun anything 
    Constructor is nothing but a like method 
    during every obj creation , Constructor will be called (no need to call the Constructor manually)


   // default Constructor
     default Constructor will take the input(variable) from inside the constructor

     Human obj= new Human();
         public Human(){
            int age=12;
            String name= "devil";
         }


   // parameterized Constructor

       in parameterized constructor, inside the class name itself we can pass value of variable
        Human obj= new Human(18,"chaithu");
        public Human(int a, String b){
          age=a;
          name=b;
         }
