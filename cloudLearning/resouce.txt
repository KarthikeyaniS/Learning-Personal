     if the resource is used in organization without a tag some conflict will happen.
    we r using tags to  know
       how and where the resource used
       how do we allocate the charges to the right team
       how to save money
       who used that resourve 

    tags will contain key and value
      key = value
      name = ui-team

    --> tags can make it easier to manage, search for, and filter resources
        we can build reports from tags using programmatic way

// untagged cost  - it will cost the owner the tag(organization won't know if they r using that account for org or their personal purpose)
