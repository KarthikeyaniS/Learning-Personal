// DOM-Document Object Modal

     HTML is used to structure the web pages and Javascript is used to add behavior to our web pages.
    When an HTML file is loaded into the browser, the javascript can not understand the HTML document directly.
     So, a corresponding document is created(DOM). DOM is basically the representation of the same HTML document but in a different format with the use of objects.
        ex: objects (h1, p, etc) 

// Directive

  1. ngIf - Strurural Directive

     <p *ngIf="condition1; else cond2">kjhgfhj</p>
     <ng-template #cond2>
        <p>kjhgfdghjk</p>
     </ng-template>

  2. [ngStyle]="{'backgroungColor': 'offline' ? 'red': 'green'}"
  3. [ngClass]= "{classname: condition==='value'}"
