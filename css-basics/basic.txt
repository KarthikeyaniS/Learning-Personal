
//selectors

        1 elements
        2 class
        3 universal
        4 id
        5 attributes

//specificity:

If there are two or more CSS rules that point to the same element, the selector with the highest specificity value will "win", and its style declaration will be applied to that HTML element.
Think of specificity as a score/rank that determines which style declaration is ultimately applied to an element.

   inline style > id > class > element   --> specificity inheritance (inline style has the highest priority)


//inheritance & specificity

element inside body will inherits styles from body. but it won't override classes and element stylings
multiple rules can apply to one element
specificity resolves multiple rules conflicts

// Combinators

section h1 {
    h1 inside section will get styled
}

2. general sibling   //element share the same parent(h1 ~ p) style will apply for all p  which in same level
3. child             // direct child will get styled (div > p) 
4. descendant        // all child will get styled (div p) all p tag will get styled within div tag
